    "text": "<p>The next release on E-Motion Records sees us very proudly welcome two new faces to the team, Kelle & Juha. Whether you know them for their face melting, dark neurofunk on Disturbed Recordings or their dance floor orientated releases on Ram’s sister label Program, these lads have a pretty hefty back catalogue and we are more than happy to be making an addition to it.</p><p>Their debut on E-Motion really highlights the duos versatility as a production outlet, as they focus more on the liquid, musical side of the genre with 2 beautifully crafted tracks entitled Mystery & Snowflakes.</p><p>First up, Mystery, a stunning piece of music reminiscent of that early Calibre sound we all know and love. Sublime keys float over warm sub bass notes as dream like vocal edits bellow in the background.</p><p>The flip side, Snowflakes, sees the duo continue on their journey of elegance with another stunningly formulated slice of Drum & Bass. Strings, guitar and piano combine to create elegant atmospherics, whilst the slick, sharp drums and resounding sub bass lay the foundations, all of which wrap up another fine release on E-Motion Records.</p><p><strong>Release Date:</strong> 05.08.2016</p>"

    "text": "<p><strong>Blueshift</strong> - Opening up with a crisp break and distinct hi-hats, Blueshift sets a tone for a track ready to take you on a journey. A breakdown of an ethereal noisescape split apart by a lumbering sub-bass soon opens up into a masterpiece of drum slicing and gorgeous pads. A relentlessly inspiritive track, be prepared to get lost in it.</p><p><strong>Section 9</strong> - Fresh drums and spectral synth work kick off Section 9 leading you unsuspectingly into the drop. The dashing bass-line pairs finely with the energetic drums, like a succulent sirloin with a shiraz, it leaves you smiling ear to ear. Solidly compelling fills keep your interest into the breakdown, the vocal sample peaking your interest and the second drop hits, bouncing your shoulders as rising synths and punchy drums continue you on your way. Definitely one for the crowd and a big system.</p><p><strong>Section 9 (Manu remix)</strong> - Up steps the man from Detached Audio bringing his take on the uncompromising Section 9. He’s kept the spirit of Section 9, but made it his own. Stripping the track back to its bare elements, he rebuilds it in a fantastically luxurious way. With enough bass to make your nan even more deaf, his lightly syncopated drum edits weave in and out of overcast pads, creating a sense of accomplished uneasiness. Let this one play out to the end.</p><p><strong>Release Date:</strong> 14.06.2016</p>"
