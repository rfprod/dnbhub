    "text": "<p><strong>Blueshift</strong> - Opening up with a crisp break and distinct hi-hats, Blueshift sets a tone for a track ready to take you on a journey. A breakdown of an ethereal noisescape split apart by a lumbering sub-bass soon opens up into a masterpiece of drum slicing and gorgeous pads. A relentlessly inspiritive track, be prepared to get lost in it.</p><p><strong>Section 9</strong> - Fresh drums and spectral synth work kick off Section 9 leading you unsuspectingly into the drop. The dashing bass-line pairs finely with the energetic drums, like a succulent sirloin with a shiraz, it leaves you smiling ear to ear. Solidly compelling fills keep your interest into the breakdown, the vocal sample peaking your interest and the second drop hits, bouncing your shoulders as rising synths and punchy drums continue you on your way. Definitely one for the crowd and a big system.</p><p><strong>Section 9 (Manu remix)</strong> - Up steps the man from Detached Audio bringing his take on the uncompromising Section 9. Heâ€™s kept the spirit of Section 9, but made it his own. Stripping the track back to its bare elements, he rebuilds it in a fantastically luxurious way. With enough bass to make your nan even more deaf, his lightly syncopated drum edits weave in and out of overcast pads, creating a sense of accomplished uneasiness. Let this one play out to the end.</p><p><strong>Release Date:</strong> 14.06.2016</p>"
